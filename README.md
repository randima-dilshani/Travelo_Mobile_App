#### 09. Documentation 

(a) Design Choices =  When designing the Travello mobile application, there are several design choices that need to be considered to ensure that the app meets the needs of its target audience - students. Some of the design choices that can be made are:

User Interface (UI) Design: The user interface of the Ever-Note mobile application should be designed to be simple, intuitive, and easy to use. The app should be visually appealing with clear and concise text, and easy-to-understand icons.

Color Scheme: The color scheme of the app should be chosen carefully to ensure that it is visually pleasing and easy on the eyes. Bright, bold colors can be used to draw attention to important information, while softer colors can be used for background elements.

Font Selection: The font used in the app should be legible and easy to read, even in small sizes. Sans-serif fonts are a good choice for digital interfaces because they are easy to read on screens of all sizes.

Navigation: The navigation within the app should be designed to be intuitive and easy to use. The main categories should be clearly labeled and easily accessible from anywhere in the app.

Responsiveness: The app should be responsive and work smoothly on different devices and screen sizes. It should be tested on various devices and platforms to ensure compatibility.

(b) Implementation Decisions = Using Xcode and Swift: The project will be developed using Xcode and Swift, as they are powerful and widely used tools for iOS development. User interface design: The user interface will be designed using UIKit, which provides a set of pre-built user interface elements that can be used to build intuitive and visually appealing interfaces. Database management: To manage the student notes data, a database will be implemented using CoreData. This will allow the application to store, retrieve, and manage the student notes data in a structured and efficient manner. Segmented control: To implement the two main categories of notes (completed studied lessons,to be continoue lessons), a segmented control will be used. This control will allow the user to select the desired lesson catergory, which will then filter the lesson list accordingly. Slider control: A slider control will be used to enable the user to select the time of they had studied that lesson. Search bar: A search bar will be implemented to enable the user to search for specific lesson in the lesson list. This will provide a convenient way for users to find the lessons they need quickly and easily. CRUD operations: The application will support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing the student notes data. This will allow the user to add, view, edit, and delete lessons from the lesson list as needed.


(c) Challenges = Developing a mobile app like "Travello" presents developers with various challenges that need to be addressed effectively. These challenges encompass different aspects of the development process and require careful management and problem-solving. Here are some key obstacles that developers may encounter and how they can overcome them:

1. Familiarity with Development Tools: Developing a mobile app often requires familiarity with programming tools such as Xcode, Swift, and UIKit. If developers lack experience or knowledge in these tools, they may need to invest additional time in learning and mastering them. Resources like manuals, tutorials, online courses, and seeking advice from experienced programmers can greatly aid in overcoming this obstacle.

2. User Interface Design: The success of a mobile app heavily relies on its user interface (UI) design. Building a user-friendly and intuitive UI that meets user expectations demands strong design skills and an understanding of UI best practices. Developers can stay updated with current UI trends, conduct usability testing with real users, and iterate on the design to ensure its effectiveness.

3. Issue Fixing and Debugging: The software development process often involves the challenging task of identifying and fixing bugs to ensure the app operates correctly. Developers may need to invest extra time in thoroughly analyzing their code, using debugging tools, and conducting systematic testing to identify and resolve issues effectively.

4. Time Management: Developing a mobile app requires effective time management, especially when dealing with other commitments. Developers need to establish a project plan with realistic deadlines, prioritize tasks, and allocate downtime to prevent burnout. By managing their time wisely and staying focused, developers can ensure they dedicate sufficient time to the development process without neglecting other responsibilities.

5. Continuous Learning: The field of mobile app development is ever-evolving, with new technologies, frameworks, and best practices emerging regularly. Developers should embrace a mindset of continuous learning and improvement, staying updated with the latest advancements in the industry. Engaging in professional development activities, attending conferences, participating in developer communities, and exploring relevant resources can help developers overcome obstacles and stay at the forefront of their craft.

By addressing these challenges through dedicated learning, effective time management, careful UI design, thorough debugging, and staying updated with industry trends, developers can navigate the complexities of developing a mobile app like "Travello" successfully. With determination and perseverance, these obstacles can be overcome, leading to a high-quality app that meets the needs of its users.

#### 10. Additional iOS Library used

MapKit: The MapKit framework is used to integrate map functionality into the app, specifically for displaying the locations on the map view. MapKit provides classes and APIs to handle map-related operations, such as displaying annotations, setting map region, and handling user interactions with the map.

#### 11. Reflection of using SwiftUI compared to UIKit

SwiftUI: A Revolutionary, Streamlined Approach to UI Development
SwiftUI is a revolutionary framework for building user interfaces in iOS apps. With its modern and declarative programming paradigm, SwiftUI simplifies UI development by allowing developers to describe the desired UI state rather than specifying each step to create and update the UI. This declarative approach eliminates the need for manual UI updates, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.

One of the key benefits of SwiftUI is its code reusability. Developers can easily compose UI elements and create reusable components, saving time and effort in building consistent interfaces across multiple screens and devices. SwiftUI's robust set of built-in views and modifiers further accelerates development by providing a comprehensive library of UI elements that can be customized to fit specific design requirements.Another significant advantage of SwiftUI is its real-time preview feature. Developers can see the changes to the UI in real-time as they write code, thanks to SwiftUI's live previews. This instant feedback greatly enhances the development workflow, allowing developers to iterate quickly, experiment with different designs, and ensure pixel-perfect UI layouts.

UIKit: The Traditional Foundation of iOS UI Development

UIKit, the long-standing UI framework in iOS development, follows an imperative and procedural programming style. Developers using UIKit have full control over every step of the UI creation and update process. They need to manually handle UI updates, responding to events and data changes by explicitly modifying the UI elements.UIKit provides extensive flexibility and control, making it a powerful tool for crafting highly customized and intricate user interfaces. It offers a wide range of UI components and advanced features, enabling developers to create visually rich and interactive app experiences.While SwiftUI introduces a modern approach to UI development, UIKit remains a solid and widely-used framework that powers countless iOS applications. Many existing apps are built with UIKit, and it continues to receive updates and support from Apple.

Choosing between SwiftUI and UIKit depends on factors such as project requirements, development timeline, and familiarity with the frameworks. SwiftUI offers a more streamlined and efficient development experience, while UIKit provides deep customization capabilities. Developers can leverage the strengths of each framework based on their specific needs and preferences.

#### 12. Reflection General
 Less Knowledge about Swift UI. So that implementation was bit difficult and most of were done going through the self study
